# Memory Symbols

This is a mini Memory game where you have to find pairs of identical cards and uses SFSymbols as cards.

This project was originally developped in 2010 as an adaptation of one of [Kek](https://zanorg.com/)'s [Bloody game](https://apps.apple.com/app/id697761522). I've decided to dig up this game to convert it to SwiftUI, as a training exercice.

You can find multiple versions of the code in Tags:
- [Objective-C](https://github.com/thibaut-jarosz/Memory-Symbols/releases/tag/Objective-C): the original version back in 2010
- [ObjC-to-Swift](https://github.com/thibaut-jarosz/Memory-Symbols/releases/tag/ObjC-to-Swift): a direct conversion of the code to Swift
- [Storyboard](https://github.com/thibaut-jarosz/Memory-Symbols/releases/tag/Storyboard): a Storyboard version that support all screen sizes and replace all original Kek's design to use SFSymbols
- SwiftUI: A SwiftUI version. Still a work in progress.
